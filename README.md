### The following sequence of scripts
with installed packages - geopy, googlemaps, io, json, math, openpyxl, os, re, requests, sys, time, xlwt

#### 01_generate_search_coords.py
Generate the radial search coordinates.  The coordinates are placed across such that radial search circles
will form a honeycomb lattice.  The maximum distance across the coordinates is sqrt(3)*R, so that circles
overlap enough to cover all area.  The script creates a __search_coords.xls__ file with coordiantes.

#### 02_qualify_search_coords_tobe_incountry.py
this script runs over all coordinates in the __search_coords.xls__ file generated by the previous script,
to qualify if the coordinate is in the United States. A column added will indicate the qualifier.

#### Manual edit of file
filter out only the coordinates within the US and store the file as __only_us_coords.xlsx__

#### 03_search_radial_all_coords_with_keyword.py
run this script on the  __only_us_coords.xlsx__ coords file _3 seperate times_. One each with argument
for keyword search : __Mosque__, __Masjid__ & __Muslim__ . each run will generate
corresponding set of files in the directory __places_search_data__

#### 04_combine_data_files_info.py
run this script with the folder (__places_search_data__) that was generated by previous script runs.
It will create a json file __composite_data_file.json__ which contains all
place nodes and their data

#### 05_create_xls_from_big_data_file.py
this script takes the __composite_data_file.json__ to generate excel file
with all the places and their fields.

#### 06_scan_website_for_hints.py
run this script with the .xlsx file from the previous scripts to scan respective
websites to determine if any of the sunni mosques are actually any other sect.

#### 07_FourSquare_Stats_for_xls_data.py
run this script with the .xlsx file as argument. It queries FourSquare API centered at the Lat,Lon
of each record with a 100m radius.  If there is a result found, it extracts the 'userscount' to proxy
for the foot-traffic at teh location.

#### 08_scan_websites_for_email_contacts.py
this script scans the website, if exists, for each record to search for email
address, if found, and record it.
